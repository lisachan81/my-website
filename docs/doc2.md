When I left Accenture, I was leading the Talent & Organisation Service Line for the Malaysia practice. We were between 60-80 people strong during my time. We provided consultancy services in HR transformation, Learning & Development, Talent management and Change Management. My clients were primarily oil & gas majors, although I also served airlines and shared service centers.

If I had to describe my work in Accenture, I'd say that I specialized in building management systems of work for my clients. It doesn't matter what business you're in, or if the nature of the work is extremely technical - most organizations have no clue why they do what they do or how they do it. And this applies to most employees as well, who just do their job as a matter of operational routine. 

I would take all of that tacit disorganized unquantified mess, and turn it into a goal-oriented consistent body of knowledge. Usually this means looking at the work and putting proper definitions in place, ways to measure value, analyze it for leakages or red flags, create space for continuous improvement and explicit means of control. 

Every problem statement or transformation program, whether small or large, can pretty much be reduced to doing simply this. My time at Accenture (10 years in all) helped hone my skills in this. I was already naturally curious, outspoken, and had a low tolerance for waste and bullshit - so it really wasn't very big leap for Accenture to use me to monetize that. 

I also took great joy in working in teams, mentoring, seeing my team grow and succeed in their roles.
