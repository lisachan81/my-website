Since I started in consulting, I've always been a bit of a zealot when it comes to fixing things. Fast forward 10 years, I made the jump to the client side and I realize just how many of those fixes just don't stick. Fast forward another 5 years and 2 transformations later, I'm still fixing shit in an eternal corporate purgatory of whack-a-mole. Oddly enough, I love doing it. There's a sick and strange sense of masochistic self-satisfaction that comes from moving giants in the direction of general improvement. 

I graduated with a Second Upper Class degree in B.A. (Hons.) Politics, Philosophy and Economics from the University of York in 2003 - apparently this is what you read at university if you didn't know what you wanted to "be", but you knew you loved money. Subsequently I took a Masters (MsC) in Management at the London School of Economics in 2004 - because that's what you took if you still had no idea where your career was headed, but you still REALLY loved money. 

Since then, I've only ever had 2 jobs. My first as a management consultant at Accenture and then at PETRONAS.
