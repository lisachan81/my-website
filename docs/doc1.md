I lead a smattering of PETRONAS Group Digital's engineering transformation initiatives. My small department drives Agile, DevOps and cloud adoption in a one-leg-kick-all fashion. We aim to improve the lives of IT practitioners, and the businesses we serve, one iteration at a time!

I'm interested in scrutinizing the organizational idiosyncracies that make true transformation easy/ challenging/ downright impossible. I commit to reading more books and learning courses than I can realistically finish. If I'm not at home playing games, I'm outside diving or hiking. I'm passionate about volunteering in local tech grassroots communities if they'll have me.  

If you must know, I graduated with a Second Upper Class degree in B.A. (Hons.) Politics, Philosophy and Economics from the University of York in 2003. I took a Masters (MsC) in Management at the London School of Economics in 2004. 

I've only ever had 2 jobs. My first as a management consultant at Accenture and then at PETRONAS.
