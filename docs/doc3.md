In the beginning (imagine my best Carl Sagan voice), I oversaw a portfolio of applications covering disciplines such as Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), asset management & integrity, plant data historians and visualisation tools, and various productivity tools for use in the office as well as the plant. My team developed a whole host of custom applications for the PETRONAS group of companies, as well acting as the system integrators for off-the-shelf OT specific software for core oil & gas operations. 

We were very successful for a time, and the products we created helped drive a lot of productivity gains for our users. Unfortunately, we often neglected the technical debt that we were accumulating over time - telling ourselves that we would fix this and that after go-live, only that time would never come. 

Now I focus full-time on driving engineering transformation initiatives that help build the kind of foundations needed to develop fast, but also reliably. I'm passionate about creating safe systems of work, which in turn reduces the human cost of incidents, outages and unplanned work. 

I like to think of my team and I as accidental knights in a crusade against heresy (think: agile has no documentation, or MVPs can't scale), and champions in a quest towards modernisation and freedom from the dark ages of legacy baggage.

Our weapons include DevOps tooling, touchless deployment strategies, shifting left for quality, everything-as-a-code and a severe addiction to lifelong learning. Join me and my honorable rogues at our round-ish table to battle the evils of manual work and willful ignorance!
