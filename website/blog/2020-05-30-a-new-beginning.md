I'd been procrastinating this for some time (read: 15 years). Building my own website was way overdue. I'd seen this great example at [low tech magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/power.html), the solar powered website. It was an inspiring story. If people out there in the world are cobbling together sun powered servers with sustainable stylesheets and serving them to viewers out of their apartments in Barcelona, what the hell was I doing with my life?

So I'd read the documentation that the guys over at low tech mag had put together, and the rationale for choosing a static site over a dynamic one. Most websites today are dymanic i.e. they're generated on demand when you visit them, so they require recurring processing and computation. Static sites are generated once and just sit in a server, regardless of whether anyone visits them or not (like your parents in an old folks home - time to visit maybe?) - and so need less energy for their upkeep. 

The low tech guys had used pelican as their static site generator, so I thought I'd give it a go. I sure as hell wouldn't be using one of those website builders with the drag and drop user interface. As one of the heads of IT in a Fortune 500, my team would not have let me live that down.

No no, it had to be something that could only be done via the CLI, hosted in AWS maybe, mandatory HTTPS, Cloudfront traffic control, Github publishing, version control, automated deployment, code scanning... omg why do I need this no one is ever going to visit.
